# DY library

The DY library is a Rust crate to quickly define a new delightful human writable syntax, optimized for redaction. This is a halfway between Markdown and YAML.

This is built to be used by the [PLX](https://github.com/samuelroland/plx) project. Future usage is also planned in [Delibay](https://samuelroland.github.io/mvp).

## Example

<!-- // TODO fix with new examples here ? -->

Definition of a programming exercise, with a pipe implementation in a custom shell started in Qemu via a `./st` script. For PLX.
